# TF2PresetChooser
> Expect more features! and possibly bugs... (BETA)

A script I made that lets you swap out custom folders and CFG folders. It also lets you automatically reset TF2!
You can see more info when choosing the "Whats this?" option in the script.

# Why?
- Easy reproducibility, can quickly let you import your TF2 configurations without the hassle!
- Preference, I always like different HUDS, or want to switch out of competitive settings every once and a while.
- Do you want to switch to a different mod folder? Simply just upload one and use it!
- Friends over, and want to use their settings? Simply just upload one and use it!
- TF2 broken? Easily use the "Reset TF2" option to fix it! Inspired by [Mastercomfig's DOCS](https://docs.comfig.app/latest/setup/clean_up/)
