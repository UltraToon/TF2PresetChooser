# Team Fortress 2: Config Editor [Windows 10+]
> [!TIP]  
> **Highly recommended to use [MasterComfig Overrides](https://docs.comfig.app/page/customization/custom_configs/)**
## A script that lets you 
- swap/rename out presets (tf/custom)
- bases (tf/cfg)
- HUDS and more!
- **Choose "What is this?" in the script for more info.**  
- Roadplan: **live switching**, **autoformat configs**, **taste chooser (simple cfg creator)**, secret..


## Why?
- Easy reproducibility, can quickly let you import your TF2 configurations without the hassle!
- Preference, I always like different HUDS, or want to switch out of competitive settings every once and a while.
- Friends over, and want to use their settings (cfg folder)? Simply just upload one and use it!
- TF2 broken? Easily use the "Reset TF2" option to fix it. Inspired by [Mastercomfig's DOCS](https://docs.comfig.app/latest/setup/clean_up/)

# Installation
> [!TIP]
> Still have questions or problems? Open an [issue](https://github.com/UltraToon/Team-Fortress-Config-Editor/issues).
1. Download the zip: [main.zip](https://github.com/UltraToon/Team-Fortress-Config-Editor/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
2. Extract the zip, make sure the contents are in a seperate folder (should be by default).
3. Double click run.bat, if you get security prompting, press run anyway. (windows didnt sign the script so it prompts warnings)

# Info

## Presets
- Swappable and renamable `tf/custom` folders that can be located anywhere!
- Just upload them to the Preset Manager and choose which one (it saves your list)

## Bases
- Same thing as presets but for `tf/cfg`

## HUD's
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Cannot load multiple HUD's at once (coming soon tho), just overlay them with folder operations**
- Same thing also, letting you swap out any huds by a dynamic list :D


## Reset TF2
> [!CAUTION]
> **This will reset all settings completely! (Unless you have autorefresh enabled)**
- Completely automatic and hidden! No manual setup or semi-automatic process.
- You can clean out configurations, or reset it completely
- You can enable AUTOREFRESH which when using the complete reset option also brings back the configs you had in the TF folder.
