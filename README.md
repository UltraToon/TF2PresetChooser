# Team Fortress 2: Config Editor [Windows 10+]
> [!TIP]  
> **Highly recommended to use [MasterComfig Overrides](https://docs.comfig.app/page/customization/custom_configs/)**
### A script that lets you 
- swap/rename out presets (tf/custom)
- swap/rename out bases (tf/cfg)
- swap/rename out HUDS and more!
- **Choose "What is this?" in the script for more info.**  
> Roadplan: **live switching**, **autoformat configs**, **taste chooser (simple cfg creator)**, secret..

# Installation
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Be warned that most options in the script **WILL** overwrite corresponding items. You can use the Export CFG's option in the Manage TF2 menu.
- Download [Team-Fortress-Config-Editor.bat](https://github.com/UltraToon/Team-Fortress-Config-Editor/releases/download/release/Team-Fortress-Config-Editor.bat) then run it.
- If you get a warning, press more info > run anyway (this is due to windows being careful of unsigned scripts)
>[Releases](https://github.com/UltraToon/Team-Fortress-Config-Editor/releases/tag/release) 

# Info

### Presets
- Swappable and renamable `tf/custom` folders that can be located anywhere!
- Just upload them to the Preset Manager and choose which one (it saves your list)

### Bases
- Same thing as presets but for `tf/cfg`

### HUD's
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Cannot load multiple HUD's at once (coming soon tho), just overlay them with folder operations**
- Same thing also, letting you swap out any huds by a dynamic list :D

### Reset TF2
> [!CAUTION]
> **This will reset all settings completely! (Unless you have autorefresh enabled)**
- Completely automatic and hidden! No manual setup or semi-automatic process.
- You can clean out configurations, or reset it completely
- You can enable AUTOREFRESH which when using the complete reset option also brings back the configs you had in the TF folder.
